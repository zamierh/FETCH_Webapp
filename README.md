When buying a hair or skin care product, most people don’t have easy access to customer reviews, pricing, allergy experiences, etc. For consumers with sensitive skin or chemical allergies, this information is critical. Currently, there are not very many reliable sources for information on these types of products. YouTube videos can be lengthy and verbose, and many product review forums currently out there force users to undergo a tedious registration process before allowing them to share their experiences. In an age where time has become more and more of a commmodity, consumers need an easier way to access this information.

Fetch makes it easy to look up and share experiences from real people about hair and skincare products. Our web application provides users with a online forum/blog environment where they can research products on the fly before they buy, giving customers confidence and peace of mind when shopping for their personal hygiene products. It is through this collaborative, worry-free atmosphere that we hope will help promote buyer confidence and increase consumer awareness. Using an interactive database, users can search by brand, name, and rating for a wide range of products. They can create a handle to post reviews, rate products, and even keep track of items. Fetch will initially be available through any internet browser, but we also plan to feature cross-platform integration for mobile access, so you can check reviews on the go. 

Our web application will be implemented using separate HTML, PHP, Javascript, and CSS files, stored in a git repository. We wanted to split the code up so it would be easier to manage and find errors. We will use HTML for content and structure of our webpage, Javascript to handle user interaction, and PHP to process inputs, outputs, and dynamic content. Any function or database calls will be coded in the Javascript and PHP files using jQuery, and we willl use Bootstrap for the framework.
